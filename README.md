#PwC-Switzerland-Power-BI-in-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Case-Experience

I am excited to share my recent experience with PwC Switzerland's Power BI Virtual Case, where I had the opportunity to dive deep into the realm of data visualization and analysis. The case revolved around three crucial areas: Call Centre Trends, Customer Retention, and Diversity & Inclusion. Let me take you through my journey of crafting impactful dashboards that unveiled valuable insights.

Task 1: Call Centre Trends

Create a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. Get creative!

Possible KPIs include (to get you started, but not limited to):

Overall customer satisfaction

Overall calls answered/abandoned

Calls by time

Average speed of answer

Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered
